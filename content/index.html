    <h1>Explorations in Linux and AWS and .Net Core</h1>
    <p>
        In the last few weeks I've been spending a lot of time learning Amazon Web Service, Docker, DynamoDB, .Net Core and more.
        I've decided to document my discoveries by means of a new blog site. Here's the plan:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a static web site hosted in S3, deployed using scripts</li>
        <li>Develop all of this on Linux</li>
        <li>Use new things for as much as possible and ignroe all my usual favourites like Visual Studio, SQL Server etc.</li>
        <li>Incrementally add features until I have a standard looking blog site.
    </ul>
    <p>
        Initially, this site is going to look pretty fugly.
    </p>
    <p>So, here we go :)</p>

    <h2>Creating the dev machine</h2>
    <p>
        My home desktop machine died recently (faultly hard drive) so I decided to start with a clean slate and install Linux. Im
        using the standard Ubuntu 16.10 LTS distro. I tried a few distro's like Mint and Budgie but my choices are constrained
        by the platforms that .Net Core supports.
    </p>
    <p>
        Installation of Ubuntu was complicated by my graphics card not being supported by the installers. This required the use of
        the nomodeset parameter when installing and after the 1st reboot. Once I got past this, I was able to install the
        correct NVidia drivers and get a nice looking desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next I installed a bunch of stuff. This couldn't be easier:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxubuntu" target="_blank">.Net Core 1.1 SDK</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
            <li>Git - sudo apt-get install git</li>
            <li>AWS CLI - sudo apt-get install awscli</li>
            <li>NodeJS and npm - sudo apt-get install nodejs npm</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html" target="_blank">Terraform</a></li>
        </ul>
        To install terraform, create a bin folder on your home directory then simply download the zip file and expand the single
        file to this. Aleternatively you can install this to /usr/bin which will let all users find it in the path.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also installed a bunch of extensions in Visual Studio Code:
        <ul>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Docker</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Terraform</li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Setting up AWS</h2>
    <p>I already had an AWS account for using free-tier resources while training myself. I want to resist creating anything
        in the AWS console and use code and script as much as possible. However, I do need to use the console to create an
        IAM account.
    </p>
    <img src="images/createiamuser.png" width=700 style="padding-left:50" />
    <p>We only want this user to have progrmmatic access - no need for the console.</p>
    <p>Next, set the permissions:</p>
    <img src="images/permissions.png" width=700 style="padding-left:50" />
    <p>I am only using S3 and Route53 for now. I'll add more permissions later if required.</p>
    <p>Next, save the IAM credentials somewhere safe and setup these in a local configuration. There are several ways to do
        this - I prefer to use a named profile rather than environment variables.I can use this profile with the AWS CLI
        and Terraform:</p>
    <img src="images/awsconfigure.png" width=500 style="padding-left:50" />
    <p>And now I can test this works:</p>
    <img src="images/s3ls.png" width=500 style="padding-left:50" />

    <h2>Creating the S3 Static Site</h2>
    <p>I will use <a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html" target="_blank">Terraform</a> to create the S3 buckets for
        the site. The site actually requires 3 buckets:
        <ul>
            <li>the main content bucket - all the html anmd images etc will live here. The DNS will point to this as jonesie.kiwi.
                Logging is truned on for this so we need... </li>
            <li>a bucket for logging hits on the site.</li>
            <li>a bucket for old school users who still use www.jonesie.kiwi.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is a step by step walkthough <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html">here</a>            that explains how to setup the buckets.</p>
    </p>
    <p> In case you don't know, Terraform is a pretty nifty tool for creating all(?) types of AWS resources. In my case, I just
        need S3 buckets with the Web Site feature enabled and Route 53 (DNS) pointing to this. The Terraform script for this
        looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre class="filename">resources.tf</pre>
    <pre>
provider "aws" {
  region  = "${var.aws_region}"
  profile = "${var.aws_profile}"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "sitebucket" {
  bucket = "${var.site_bucket_name}"
  acl    = "public-read"

  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"
  }

  logging {
    target_bucket = "${aws_s3_bucket.sitebucket-log.id}"
    target_prefix = "log/"
    
  }

  policy = &lt;&lt;EOF
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Sid": "Allow Public Access to All Objects",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::${var.site_bucket_name}/*"
  }
 ]
}
EOF
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "sitebucket-log" {
  bucket = "logs.${var.site_bucket_name}"
  acl    = "log-delivery-write"

  lifecycle_rule {
    id = "log"
    prefix = "log/"
    enabled = true

    expiration {
      days = 30
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "sitebucket-www" {
  bucket = "www.${var.site_bucket_name}"
  acl    = "public-read"
  
  website {
    redirect_all_requests_to = "${var.site_bucket_name}"
  }
}

data "aws_route53_zone" "zone" {
  name = "${var.domain_name}"
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "siteroot" {
  zone_id = "${data.aws_route53_zone.zone.zone_id}"
  name    = "${var.domain_name}"
  type    = "A"

  alias {
    name                   = "${aws_s3_bucket.sitebucket.website_domain}"
    zone_id                = "${aws_s3_bucket.sitebucket.hosted_zone_id}"
    evaluate_target_health = false
  }
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "sitewww" {
  zone_id = "${data.aws_route53_zone.zone.zone_id}"
  name    = "www.${var.domain_name}"
  type    = "A"

  alias {
    name                   = "${aws_s3_bucket.sitebucket.website_domain}"
    zone_id                = "${aws_s3_bucket.sitebucket.hosted_zone_id}"
    evaluate_target_health = false
  }
}
    </pre>
    <pre class="filename">variables.tf</pre>
    <pre>
variable "aws_profile" {}
variable "aws_region" {}
variable "site_bucket_name" {}
    </pre>
    <p>
        I placed the above two files in a directory called aws. Then I created a shell script to apply this:
    </p>
    <pre class="filename">deploy.sh</pre>
    <pre>
#!/bin/bash

echo Deploy static site to jonesie.kiwi

aws_profile="jonesie-kiwi"
aws_region="us-west-2"
domain_name="jonesie.kiwi"
site_bucket_name="jonesie.kiwi"
site_bucket_url="http://$site_bucket_name.s3-website-$aws_region.amazonaws.com"

# create the aws infrastructure
terraform apply \
    -var "aws_profile=$aws_profile" \
    -var "aws_region=$aws_region" \
    -var "domain_name=jonesie.kiwi" \
    -var "site_bucket_name=$site_bucket_name" \
    aws

# copy the content to the bucket
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
    aws s3 cp \
        content/ s3://$site_bucket_name \
        --profile $aws_profile \
        --recursive 
fi
        </pre>
    <p>
        Now I can run the script, remembering to SUDO of course.
    </p>
    <h2>Updating the domain</h2>
    <p>The final step is to update my domain registry with the AWS name server records. This is a manual step as I cant script this.</p>

<h2>Next?</h2>
<p>Creating blog posts in raw HTML is pretty tedious so I think I'll work on a front end UI next. I should be able to create some javascript that uses S3 as a back end 'database'.   I'd like to know if anyone if reading this :) There's no way of sending me feedback other than by emailing me (peter@jonesie.net.nz). I have also posted the code to github - https://github.com/Jonesie/staticweb</p>
